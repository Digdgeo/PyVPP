    "With the above sentence we are importing the python class to download from Wekeo (wekeo_download) and 2 small functions to deal with the .hdarc config file (fillHda and delHdaInfo). The fillHda(\"user, \"password\" is used to create or rewrite the .hdarc config file used by wekeo-hda library with your user account data. The delHdaInfo() just remove your account information from the file. This is helpful just in shared enviroments such as the Datalab, where maybe you don't want to keep your secrets. In case you run this from your personal computer, just create your .hdarc files (manually or just running fillHda(\"user\", \"pass\") the first time and forget about these functions.  "
